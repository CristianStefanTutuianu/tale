Hello! You're here because you're looking to hire me, or work with me or just curious on how my life has been so far. Here:

In a nutshell, I love technology, which is a bit of an accident, so to speak. 

When I was a kid I had no clue what I want to be when I grow up. My grandpa taught me to follow my dreams. At six, my dreams were the lizards you could find in the fields of Ploiesti outskirts. And so I learned how to catch them. Most people were affraid, disgusted or simply could not understand the beauty of chasing and failing and chasing and eventually with a bit of luck getting that good looking one. Heck, I built what I used to call  "A mini Jurassic Park". That's about who I am.

I've got in touch with Computer Science as an out of poverty solution. Back in 2012, I did not know I would get to love, sleep, eat and breathe technology. It was a rather fortunate and a lucky decision. Today I have a degree from this awesome place where they study the [human brain - spinnaker project - @University of Manchester](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/) and a few years of experience working with and for start-ups and tech giants.
