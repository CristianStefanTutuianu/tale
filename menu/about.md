# Career

Hi! This might seem odd to you, yet I can't rest. I have a high work tolerance and I get my energy from achieving. 

I love technology and that is an accident, so to speak. 

When I was a kid I had no clue what to do when I grow up. So I looked at which jobs pay well. Computer Science seemed to be a good investment. Up until my 3rd year in university there was nothing remarkable about my relationship with tech. And then reality hit, a reality that took me from a barely passing student to a solid first class. 

That was when I discovered the value in mentorship and learning from other people mistakes. That's when I was told and actually listened to: It does not matter where you come from and who you are, if you put your everything, you'll get what you want. And so I did and I never stopped ever since.
