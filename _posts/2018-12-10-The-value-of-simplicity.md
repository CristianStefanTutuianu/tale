```The vast majority of problems in business (including engineering) are so basic that a key solution is education in and consistency of using simple, enjoyable thinking.```

When I started my journey as a developer I was measuring my success by the amount of code I was pushing in production.
While this did serve well for a while it surely became a metric which was rather distracting me from my overall engineering progress. Sure, setting a rule to push more code week by week, helped me rise through the ranks and gain the trust of my
team and others.

The problem with the above is that I soon found out that the people who I admired pushed maybe half the amount of code I was pushing. Yet they were really good at finding problems in the code I wrote. I wanted that for myself. 

That’s when I set a new target: drive more business value with less code. A few months later I had a major win in splitting a health metric on a large scale service - 10+ millions of customers every day. It took me one line to transferred unclear ownership to established teams and also improve the OE diagnosis process leading to increased customer satisfaction.

While there is a lot going on around the idea of simplicity - check out this site - https://less.works,  sometimes it might not tailor best for beginners. You have to fall into a pit at least once to learn how to climb one, right?! Hence, once you’ve master the basics - fallen into the pit, adopting simple thinking is the natural next step. Use it right and it will get you ahead of the crowd - in tiny, yet valuable steps.
