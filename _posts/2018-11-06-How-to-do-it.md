## How did I stop smoking and how you can do it too...

I promise you, it's not another one of those, rather, just an honest view on the matter which might be useful to some given I have 10 years of smoking tied to my lungs. So how do you do it?!

It took me: one funeral, my grandpa's, a video with his struggle and a bit of guilt driven research. He died of lung cancer. It was shitty, to sum it up. On top, consider the prospects of future kids, future kids growing without a dad, or worse, a dad unable to provide, a mom who forgot how happy really feels like and so on.

Statistics say 24% of the smoking population in my age category end up with a form of cancer due to smoking. That a risk worth taking? I don't think so. 

However, the human mind is like a chewing gum in front of statistics: 76% chance of not getting cancer if you smoke sounds much better, so good that you might even consider disregarding it. After all, something random can kill you, and 76% are better odds than random. But then, then you factor in integrity, love of life and people & self control. It doesn't take a genius to realise smoking is against every single value you hold dear. On top, you are an easy target when willingly you poison yourself, it is also easy to be influenced by literally anything. 

In order to do it, you need to re-wire yourself. This is my second and last attempt. How do I know this? Because I have learned where the weak resided during my first attempt: failing to see the big picture for once and being a selfish prick. Here is my give-up smoking short as fuck bucket list:

### Get an anchor!

Somebody dear, special, lover, kids, parents, friend. It has to be somebody you care deeply about. Every time you have an impulse for smoking, bring out the picture of that person. Picture your future together,  picture great memories ahead. Pause! Now, picture your funeral while not being able to comfort him/her. If that gets boring, try to rationally explain to that person why you chose to live less, despite every good reason he/she gave you. 

### Speak up!

There will be moments, moments when being rational will fail you. Call your anchor/s, be open. Ask him/her for a good reason you should not smoke. Why this will work? Let's dig a little on what a cigarette does: a simple instant gratification mechanism. You smoke, you get your serotonine up. Guess what, somebody dear can give you about the same, even better, free of charge.

### You never smoked!

It was a bad dream. You might find yourself dreaming about these orange but suckers. That's fine, it's part of your old self. If you wake up just after, be glad, it was just a bad dream. You need to internalise this. Harari speaks about delusion, made up concepts and so on. If you admit Facebook is an entity, but also realise that it is a very complex inter-subjective entity made up by a working set of laws and regulations, you can also trick yourself into believing you never ever smoked. 

### Bonus idea

Take the money you don't spend on cigarettes and use it to open a fund for you and your anchor. Time to get some awesome memories every now and then. I was amazed by the maths alone. Both: anchor and I decided to quit. Funny, we live 1000 miles apart. She spends around £60 on cigarettes, while I spend around £160. That's £220 each month, or £2600/year. That's easiily a 7-Day trip for both of us anywhere in the world, for example.
