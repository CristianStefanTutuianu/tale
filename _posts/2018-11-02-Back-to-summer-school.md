## Summary

Last summer I had a moment when I felt I needed to give back, anything, I wanted to prove myself I'm worth the trouble. Also I really did want to check if public speaking still causes me an orgasm. It surely did!

So I came up with a plan. Instead of having a chill vacation I switched it for a tiny bit of hedonism. A three days workshop where I was going to introduce high-school kids to programming, with or without them having a priori knowledge. The hardest bit was starting it, figuring out the dates and aligning everybody around my schedule. It eventually worked out and I got the sign
off from my former high-school.


## The 16 hours work day

So where do I start? If anything, I started picturing how what making a difference would feel like for my curious minds. I needed a vision and some advertising. I needed a plan which must include everybody attending.

Some say being a leader doesn't require you to inspire people, but rather getting yourself inspired by them. That might sound like a cliche, but think about it. If by what you do, you get people so caught up in the process that they surprise you with devotion, creativity, curiosity and so on it means you managed to lead a vision past the inter-subjective label attached with the initial offering.

Since it was the first time I was organising this kind of event, I started drafting a vision which eventually got to be: "Programming is empowering, rewarding and ultimately fun. Anybody can do it!" Then values and motivation followed. It was a

It was a joy to then see secondary school kids working alongside high-school kids. Of course, that meant a lot of variation in emotional & cognitive development for each and every kid. This was perfect, exactly life.

This is what a group of 32 awesome kids managed to do in 12 hours of coding. From scratch! Isn't it pure awesomeness? Kudos to them all!

## Teaching plan

### Day 1
TBD

### Day 2
TBD

### Day 3
TBD

## Conclusions
Children are a joy if you know to make them feel valued
Creativity at 10 - 12 - 15 is a weapon which should not be taken by a stiffen, rugged education system.

TBD - Include data from children
