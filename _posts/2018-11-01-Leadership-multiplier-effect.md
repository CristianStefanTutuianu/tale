This is a book I randomly picked while on a flight to Portugal. Not my style, but I was surprised to find a leisure style, exactly the kind of book you would read if you are on vacation, have a curiosity for leadership and just love people as much as I do! This is my first post, just heads up, I tend to mambo-jumbo what the author says with what I think.

# Ideas and tips:

## To cut up your to-do list in half, simply get your to-do list and cut it in half
This idea can be found in many modern authors, for example Mark Manson who shelves it a bit different. In short life is a series of problems. You solve one, just to get a better one. You just have to pick the right problems for you and then sprint with a big smile on your face.

## The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do
I think this is one of the pillars in every strategic plan. Let's say we speak chess. Well, you'd better not lose those two pawns in the Danish opening, unless you know what you're doing. Same is everywhere else. Don't eat the extra cake slice just because it is there, and don't let a bad mood spread around, just because it happened to you. Remember, you are, after all, just a small potato. Like any other potato, you have limited amount of energy and that energy besides being pure awesomeness, must be carefully planned and distributed so that it will help other potatoes to grow around you. Got me?

Another way to put this: There are so many things you can do, and just a few NO-NOs. If you can identify the no-nos, then you'll be astonishingly right most of the times. That easy!

## Leadership isn't about what happens when you're there. It's about what happens when you're not.
Two things here. First, motivation should be intrinsic. What? Yeah, check this out. What's the role of a leader? Say a manager, from Andy, it seems to be that of motivating people to go past and beyond their job description. How can this be done? Well, not with punishment - remember: choose what not to do. Punishment uselessness is most famous exemplified by a study where two groups of kids were left alone in a room, each kid with a candy and two promises. First group: if you don't eat it in the next 10 minutes, you're going to get an extra one. Second group: if you eat it in the next 10 minutes you'll be sent to your room for the rest of the day. Guess which group got a little chubby?

Second point is that you should show your intrinsic motivation and how it gets you to be awesome because you have it. The rest will follow.
