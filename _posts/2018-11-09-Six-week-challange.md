A few weeks ago I saw an idea on Medium which I felt for. It goes like this: Each month, for the next 12 months, I will learn a new skill. 

12 months is a lot to prove the value of an MVP and as I value my time, and generally speaking, agility in execution without compromising on quality, I will test run the idea for 6 weeks.

## Approach

As my weeks tend to be quite crammed, I will demote half of my free Sunday in favour of the challange. To keep the flow going I will dedicate between 30 and 60 minutes on all other weekdays. Thus I will dedicate approximately 10 hours per week for the challange. This leaves me with enough time for about 3 skills which, oddly, I picked:

  - __Macro-economics__
  - __Public speaking__
  - __Acting__
