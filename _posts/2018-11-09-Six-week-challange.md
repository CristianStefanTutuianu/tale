I've recently read a post on Medium: 12 months challange - where the guy spent a month learning something new. 

I loved the idea, but I also value my time, and generally speaking, agility in execution without compromising on quality.
Hence it's time for my own test-run. 

For the next 6 weeks I will do a push and pick up 6 new things. 

## Strategy 

TBD
