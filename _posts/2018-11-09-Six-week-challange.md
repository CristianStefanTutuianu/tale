A few weeks ago I saw an idea on Medium which I felt for. It goes like this: Each month, for the next 12 months, I will learn a new skill. 

12 months is a lot to prove the value of an MVP and as I value my time, and generally speaking, agility in execution without compromising on quality, hence I will test-run the idea for 4 weeks only.

## Approach

As my week tends to be quite crammed, I will demote half of my free Sunday in favour of the challange. To keep the flow going I will dedicate between 30 and 60 minutes on all other weekdays. Thus I will dedicate approximately 10 hours per week for the challange. This leaves me with enough time for about 1 thing:

  - __Leadership coaching__
  
  To do so I signed up for University of Illinois's course on leadership as part of their iMBA programme.
  Furthermore I got a lot of interesting (this time confidential) reading material from my mentors.
